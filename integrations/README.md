# MUI Template Integrations

This directory contains auto-generated integrations of MUI templates into various project types (e.g., Vite, Next.js, Create React App). These integrations are automatically created by Cursor when you use a template from the `cursor-mui-templates` directory.

## Structure

Each integration is contained in its own subdirectory with the following naming convention:
- `[project-type]-[template-name]`

Example:
- `vite-mui-about/` - Vite integration of the About page template

## Usage

These integrations are automatically generated when you use Cursor to add a template to your project. You don't need to manually copy or modify these files.

## Purpose

The integrations folder serves as:
1. A reference for how templates are integrated into different project types
2. A testing ground for template integrations
3. A way to verify that templates work correctly in different environments

## Note

Do not manually modify files in this directory as they are auto-generated. If you need to make changes to a template, modify the source files in the `cursor-mui-templates` directory instead.
