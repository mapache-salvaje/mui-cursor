This project contains experiments using Cursor Rules to establish best practices for building with Material UI (MUI) components and other popular React libraries and frameworks.

## Project Structure

└── mui-v6-vite-setup.mdc      # Standards for MUI v6 + Vite project setup
```

## Purpose

This repository serves as a collection of Cursor Rules that help maintain consistent development practices when working with:
- Material UI v6
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Vite
- And other modern React tooling

## Getting Started

Each rule in the `.cursor/rules` directory contains detailed documentation about its purpose and requirements. The rules are designed to be used with Cursor IDE to enforce best practices and maintain consistency across projects.
