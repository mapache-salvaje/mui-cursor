         - Test rule compliance

      4. Rule Verification:
         - Verify rule understanding
         - Check rule applicability
         - Validate rule compliance

         - Add missing rules
         - Fix rule conflicts

      7. Rule Communication:
         - Explain rule choices
         - Document rule rationale
         - Share rule knowledge
         - Train on rule usage

         - NEVER ignore rule conflicts
         - ALWAYS document rule decisions
         - NEVER bypass rule checks
         - ALWAYS verify rule compliance

      10. Rule Integration:
          - Connect related rules
          - Build rule hierarchy
          - Manage rule dependencies
          - Handle rule overlaps
          - Resolve rule conflicts

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Starting task without reading rules
      "Let me start implementing this feature..."
      "I'll just write the code first..."
      "Rules can wait until later..."

      # Good: Following the master rule
      "First, let me read all the rules..."
      "I need to check rule priorities..."
      "Let me verify rule compliance..."
      "I'll document my rule decisions..."
    output: "ALWAYS read and understand all rules before starting any task"
