    message: |
      Cursor rule files must follow this exact format:

      1. Frontmatter (REQUIRED):
         ```yaml
         ---
         description: Clear description of the rule's purpose
         globs: ["*"]  # Use simple glob unless specifically required otherwise
         alwaysApply: true
         ---
         ```
         - MUST be the first thing in the file
         - MUST contain description, globs, and alwaysApply
         - No spaces after the dashes
         - Single line break after opening dash
         - Single line break before closing dash
         - Keep globs simple unless complex patterns are required

      2. Title and Description:
         ```markdown
         # Rule Name
         Brief description of what the rule does
         ```
         - Single line break after frontmatter
         - Single line break after title
         - Single line break after description

      3. Rule Definition:
         ```yaml
         <rule>
         name: rule-name
         description: Detailed description
         filters:
           - type: file_extension|content|event
             pattern: "regex pattern"
         actions:
           - type: reject|suggest|execute
             conditions:
               - pattern: "regex pattern"
             message: "Error message"
         examples:
           - input: "Example input"
             output: "Expected output"
         metadata:
           priority: high|medium|low
           version: "1.0"
         </rule>
         ```
         - Single line break before rule block
         - No extra spaces in YAML indentation
         - All sections must be present
         - No trailing spaces

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Missing frontmatter
      # My Rule
      <rule>
      name: my-rule
      </rule>

      # Bad: Incomplete frontmatter
      ---
      description: My rule
      ---

      # Bad: Complex glob pattern
      ---
      description: My rule
      globs: ["*.ts", "*.tsx", "src/**/*.js"]
      alwaysApply: false
      ---

      # Good: Complete frontmatter with simple glob
      ---
      description: My rule
      globs: ["*"]
      alwaysApply: true
      ---
    output: "Rule files must have complete frontmatter with all required fields and simple glob pattern"

  priority: high
  version: 1.0
