      Cursor rule files must follow this exact format:

      1. Frontmatter (required):
         ```yaml
         ---
         description: Clear description of the rule's purpose
         globs: ["file patterns to match"]
         alwaysApply: false
         ---
         ```
         - No spaces after the dashes
         - Single line break after opening dash
         - Single line break before closing dash
         - All fields must be present

      2. Title and Description:
         ```markdown
         # Rule Name
         Brief description of what the rule does
         ```
         - Single line break after frontmatter
         - Single line break after title
         - Single line break after description

      3. Rule Definition:
         ```yaml
         <rule>
         name: rule-name
         description: Detailed description
         filters:
           - type: file_extension|content|event
             pattern: "regex pattern"
         actions:
           - type: reject|suggest|execute
             conditions:
               - pattern: "regex pattern"
             message: "Error message"

         </rule>
         ```
         - Single line break before rule block
         - No extra spaces in YAML indentation
         - All sections must be present
