    message: |
      Cursor rule files must follow this exact format:

      1. Frontmatter (REQUIRED):
         ```markdown
         ---
         description: Clear description of the rule's purpose
         globs: ["*"]
         alwaysApply: true
         ---
         ```
         - MUST be the first content in ANY rule file or proposal
         - MUST contain exactly these three fields
         - MUST use ["*"] for globs unless specifically required otherwise
         - MUST NOT have extra spaces after dashes
         - MUST be separated by single line breaks
         - MUST be followed by a single blank line

      2. Rule Content Structure:
         ```markdown
         # Rule Name

         Brief description of what the rule does.

         <rule>
         name: rule-name
         description: Detailed description
         filters:
           - type: file_extension|content|event
             pattern: "regex pattern"
         actions:
           - type: reject|suggest|execute
             conditions:
               - pattern: "regex pattern"
             message: "Error message"
         examples:
           - input: "Example input"
             output: "Expected output"
         metadata:
           priority: high|medium|low
           version: "1.0"
         </rule>
         ```

      3. Formatting Requirements:
         - No tabs, use spaces for indentation
         - No more than two consecutive blank lines
         - Consistent indentation in YAML sections
         - Clear separation between sections
         - Proper markdown heading hierarchy
         - Consistent code block formatting

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: No frontmatter
      # My Rule
      <rule>
      name: my-rule
      </rule>

      # Bad: Incomplete frontmatter
      ---
      description: My rule
      ---

      # Bad: Extra spaces
      ---  
      description: My rule
      globs: ["*"]
      alwaysApply: true
      ---  

      # Good: Complete and properly formatted
      ---
      description: My rule
      globs: ["*"]
      alwaysApply: true
      ---
    output: "Rule files must have complete and properly formatted frontmatter"
