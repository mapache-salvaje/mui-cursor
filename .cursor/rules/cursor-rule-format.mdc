      Cursor rule files must follow this exact format:

      1. Frontmatter (required):
         ```yaml
         ---
         description: Clear description of the rule's purpose
         globs: ["*"]  # Use simple glob unless specifically required otherwise
         alwaysApply: true
         ---
         ```
         - No spaces after the dashes
         - Single line break after opening dash
         - Single line break before closing dash
         - All fields must be present
         - Keep globs simple unless complex patterns are required

      2. Title and Description:
         ```markdown
         # Rule Name
         Brief description of what the rule does
         ```
         - Single line break after frontmatter
         - Single line break after title
         - Single line break after description

      3. Rule Definition:
         ```yaml
         <rule>
         name: rule-name
         description: Detailed description
         filters:
           - type: file_extension|content|event
             pattern: "regex pattern"
         actions:
           - type: reject|suggest|execute
             conditions:
               - pattern: "regex pattern"
             message: "Error message"
         examples:
           - input: "Example input"
             output: "Expected output"
         metadata:
           priority: high|medium|low
           version: "1.0"
         </rule>
         ```
         - Single line break before rule block
         - No extra spaces in YAML indentation
         - All sections must be present
         - No trailing spaces

examples:
  - input: |
      ---
      description: My rule
      globs: ["*.ts", "*.tsx", "src/**/*.js"]
      alwaysApply: false
      ---
    output: "Rejected: Use simple glob ['*'] unless complex patterns required"

  - input: |
      ---
      description: My rule
      globs: ["*"]
      alwaysApply: true
      ---
    output: "Accepted: Simple glob pattern used"
