      When documenting or modifying project structure:

      1. ALWAYS verify first:
         - Use list_dir to check directory contents
         - Verify each subdirectory exists
         - Only document what you can see
         - If unsure, check parent directory

      2. NEVER assume:
         - Don't guess directory contents
         - Don't copy from other projects
         - Don't document what you think should be there
         - Don't make up folder structures

      3. If you made a mistake:
         - Correct it immediately
         - Document the correction
         - Explain what went wrong
         - Learn from the mistake

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Making assumptions
      "This directory contains X, Y, Z..."
      "The project has these components..."
      "There are templates for..."

      # Good: Verified contents
      "After running list_dir on /path:
      - file1.ts
      - file2.ts"
    output: "Only document what you can verify exists"
