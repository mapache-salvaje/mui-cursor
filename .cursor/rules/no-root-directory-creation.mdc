      When creating new projects or files:

      1. ALWAYS create in integrations/ directory:
         ```bash
         integrations/your-project-name/
         ```

      2. NEVER create in root directory:
         - No direct project creation
         - No npm init in root
         - No create-next-app in root
         - No mkdir in root
         - No file creation in root

      3. Required steps:
         - First verify integrations/ exists
         - Create project in integrations/
         - Keep root directory clean
         - Follow established structure

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Creating in root
      mkdir my-project
      npm init my-project
      create-next-app my-project

      # Good: Creating in integrations
      mkdir integrations/my-project
      cd integrations/my-project
      npm init
      create-next-app .
    output: "Always create new projects in the integrations/ directory"
