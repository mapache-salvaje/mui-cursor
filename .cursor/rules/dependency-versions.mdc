      When setting up dependencies in a MUI project:

      1. Core Dependencies:
         ```json
         {
           "dependencies": {
             "@emotion/react": "^11.11.3",
             "@emotion/styled": "^11.11.0",
             "@mui/icons-material": "^6.4.7",
             "@mui/lab": "^5.0.0-alpha.165",  // Note: Lab follows independent versioning
             "@mui/material": "^6.4.7",
             "react": "^19.0.0",  // Must be version 19 or higher
             "react-dom": "^19.0.0"  // Must match React version
           }
         }
         ```

      2. Development Dependencies:
         ```json
         {
           "devDependencies": {
             "@types/node": "^20.11.19",
             "@types/react": "^19.0.0",  // Must match React version
             "@types/react-dom": "^19.0.0",  // Must match React DOM version
             "@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin": "^7.0.1",
             "@typescript-eslint/parser": "^7.0.1",
             "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^4.2.1",
             "eslint": "^8.56.0",
             "eslint-plugin-react-hooks": "^4.6.0",
             "eslint-plugin-react-refresh": "^0.4.5",
             "typescript": "^5.2.2",
             "vite": "^5.1.3"
           }
         }
         ```

      3. Important Notes:
         - Always use the latest stable version of @mui/material
         - @mui/lab follows its own versioning scheme and should be updated independently
         - React must be version 19 or higher
         - React DOM version must match React version
         - Keep all TypeScript types in sync with their respective packages
         - Use the latest stable versions of all development tools
         - Never downgrade packages unless absolutely necessary
         - Avoid using beta versions unless specifically required

      4. Version Compatibility:
         - @mui/material and @mui/icons-material versions should match
         - @mui/lab version is independent and should be the latest alpha
         - React and React DOM versions must match and be 19+
         - TypeScript types should match their package versions

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Mismatched versions or React < 19
      "@mui/material": "^6.4.7",
      "@mui/icons-material": "^5.15.10",
      "@mui/lab": "^6.4.7",
      "react": "^18.2.0"

      # Good: Correct versioning with React 19+
      "@mui/material": "^6.4.7",
      "@mui/icons-material": "^6.4.7",
      "@mui/lab": "^5.0.0-alpha.165",
      "react": "^19.0.0"
    output: "Use matching versions for material and icons, independent versioning for lab, and React 19+"
