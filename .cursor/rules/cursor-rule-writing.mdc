      When writing Cursor rules:

      1. Frontmatter (REQUIRED):
         ```markdown
         ---
         description: Clear description of the rule's purpose
         globs: ["*"]
         alwaysApply: true
         ---
         ```
         - MUST be the first content in the file
         - MUST include all three fields exactly as shown
         - MUST use ["*"] for globs unless specifically required otherwise
         - MUST be included when proposing ANY new rule content
         - MUST be separated by single line breaks
         - MUST NOT contain extra spaces after dashes

      2. Rule Structure:
         ```markdown
         ---
         [frontmatter]
         ---

         # Rule Name

         Brief description of what the rule does.

         <rule>
         name: rule-name
         description: Detailed description
         filters:
           - type: file_extension|content|event
             pattern: "regex pattern"
         actions:
           - type: reject|suggest|execute
             conditions:
               - pattern: "regex pattern"
             message: "Error message"
         examples:
           - input: "Example input"
             output: "Expected output"
         metadata:
           priority: high|medium|low
           version: "1.0"
         </rule>
         ```

      3. Rule Writing Guidelines:
         - Keep descriptions clear and concise
         - Use proper markdown formatting
         - Include relevant examples
         - Test rules with different inputs
         - Document all conditions and actions
         - Use consistent naming conventions
         - Keep rules focused and single-purpose
         - NEVER omit frontmatter when proposing rule content

      4. Rule Types:
         - File extension rules
         - Content pattern rules
         - Event-based rules
         - Project structure rules
         - Code style rules

      5. Action Types:
         - reject: Block changes
         - suggest: Provide guidance
         - execute: Run commands
         - validate: Check conditions

      6. Testing:
         - Test with valid inputs
         - Test with invalid inputs
         - Test edge cases
         - Verify rule behavior
         - Check error messages

      7. Maintenance:
         - Keep rules up to date
         - Document changes
         - Version control
         - Review periodically
         - Remove obsolete rules

      8. Important Notes:
         - NEVER write directly to .mdc files
         - ALWAYS include frontmatter in rule proposals
         - Follow established patterns
         - Keep rules simple and focused
         - Document all assumptions
         - Consider edge cases
         - Test thoroughly

      9. Creating Rules for Users:
         - Create rule files in .cursor/rules/ directory
         - Use proper file naming (kebab-case)
         - Include complete frontmatter
         - Follow the standard rule structure
         - Provide clear examples
         - Test the rule before committing
         - Use conventional commits for rule changes
         - NEVER commit changes until after user has reviewed and copied the content

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Missing or incomplete frontmatter
      # Rule Name
      <rule>
      name: my-rule
      </rule>

      # Bad: Extra spaces in frontmatter
      ---  
      description: My rule
      globs: ["*"]
      alwaysApply: true
      ---  

      # Good: Complete and properly formatted
      ---
      description: My rule
      globs: ["*"]
      alwaysApply: true
      ---
    output: "Always include properly formatted frontmatter"

metadata:
  priority: critical
  version: 2.0
