      When writing Cursor rules:

      1. File Structure:
         ```
         .cursor/rules/
         ├── rule-name.mdc
         ```

      2. Rule File Structure:
         ```markdown

         globs: ["file patterns to match"]

         # Rule Name

         Brief description of what the rule does.

         filters:
           - type: file_extension|content|event
             pattern: "regex pattern"
         actions:
           - type: reject|suggest|execute
             conditions:
               - pattern: "regex pattern"
             message: "Error message"
         examples:
           - input: "Example input"
             output: "Expected output"
         metadata:
           priority: high|medium|low
           version: "1.0"
         </rule>
         ```

      3. Rule Writing Guidelines:
         - Keep descriptions clear and concise
         - Use proper markdown formatting
         - Include relevant examples
         - Test rules with different inputs
         - Document all conditions and actions
         - Use consistent naming conventions
         - Keep rules focused and single-purpose

      4. Rule Types:
         - File extension rules
         - Content pattern rules
         - Event-based rules
         - Project structure rules
         - Code style rules

      5. Action Types:
         - reject: Block changes
         - suggest: Provide guidance
         - execute: Run commands
         - validate: Check conditions

      6. Testing:
         - Test with valid inputs
         - Test with invalid inputs
         - Test edge cases
         - Verify rule behavior
         - Check error messages

      7. Maintenance:
         - Keep rules up to date
         - Document changes
         - Version control
         - Review periodically
         - Remove obsolete rules

      8. Important Notes:
         - NEVER write directly to .mdc files
         - Always provide rule content for manual review
         - Follow established patterns
         - Keep rules simple and focused
         - Document all assumptions
         - Consider edge cases
         - Test thoroughly

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Writing directly to .mdc file
      Attempting to edit .mdc file directly

      # Good: Providing content for manual review
      Providing content for user to copy and paste
    output: "Never write directly to .mdc files"
