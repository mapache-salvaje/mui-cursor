      When creating new integrations or templates:

      1. First check if there are existing files that can be duplicated
      2. Only create new files from scratch if no suitable existing files are found
      3. When duplicating files:
         - Maintain the same structure and patterns
         - Update only the necessary parts (like imports, paths, etc.)
         - Keep the core functionality intact
      4. Document any modifications made to the duplicated files

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Creating from scratch
      Creating new files without checking existing ones

      # Good: Reusing existing code
      Duplicating and modifying existing files
    output: "Always check for existing files to duplicate before creating new ones"
