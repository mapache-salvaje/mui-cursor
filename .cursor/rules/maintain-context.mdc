      When receiving user-provided context:

      1. Directory Structure:
         ```
         .cursor/
         ├── context/              # User-provided context
         │   ├── images/          # Screenshots and visual references
         │   ├── code/           # Code snippets and examples
         │   └── requirements/   # Written requirements and specs
         ```

      2. Required Steps:
         - Create .cursor/context if it doesn't exist
         - Organize content by type in subdirectories
         - Timestamp each addition
         - Maintain version history
         - Never delete without user approval

      3. Context Types:
         - Images: Screenshots, mockups, design references
         - Code: Snippets, examples, reference implementations
         - Requirements: Written specs, user stories, constraints
         - Links: References to external resources
         - History: Previous conversation context

      4. File Naming:
         - Use descriptive names
         - Include timestamps
         - Use appropriate extensions
         - Follow format: type_description_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS

      5. Metadata Requirements:
         - Original source
         - Timestamp
         - Context type
         - Related components
         - User instructions

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Not saving context
      User shares screenshot
      AI proceeds without saving

      # Good: Maintaining context
      User shares screenshot
      AI saves to .cursor/context/images/homepage_reference_20240307_204500.png
    output: "Save all user-provided context in appropriate directory"
