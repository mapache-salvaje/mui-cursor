      When solving problems:

      1. Start with the simplest solution
      2. Only add complexity if absolutely necessary
      3. If you find yourself overcomplicating:
         - Stop
         - Take a step back
         - Find the simplest way
      4. One change at a time
      5. No unnecessary refactoring

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Overcomplicated
      Complex solution with multiple layers
      Multiple unrelated changes
      Unnecessary abstractions

      # Good: Simple
      Direct fix
      Single focused change
      Clear and obvious solution
    output: "Choose the simplest solution that works"
