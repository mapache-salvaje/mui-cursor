      When managing development servers:

      1. Check Server Status:
         - Before starting a new server, verify if one exists
         - Note the port number being used
         - Check if hot reload is active

      2. Server Management:
         - Use existing server when available
         - Hot reload handles most changes automatically
         - Use 'rs' to restart when necessary
         - Only start new server if none exists

      3. Project Separation:
         - Track servers by project directory
         - Allow multiple servers for different projects
         - Use different ports for different projects
         - Document port assignments

      4. Configuration Changes:
         - Hot reload for component/page changes
         - Restart ('rs') for next.config.js changes
         - Full restart after package.json changes

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Starting new server when one exists
      npm run dev  # When server already running

      # Good: Using existing server
      # Let hot reload handle changes
      # Or use 'rs' to restart if needed
    output: "Use existing server or restart with 'rs'"
